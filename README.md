# Tuesday

**Tuesday** is a comments engine written in Python.

## Features

### Headless
Tuesday comments UI agnostic. It aims to provide all APIs needed for common comments implemntations.

### Scalability
Tuesday aims to scale well for medium sized web sites.

### Easier moderation

## Tuesday?
The project was born on Tuesday. I considered various names but couldn't freeze on one so chose the name of the day it was born.

## Why
There are a few existing options such as Coralproject's Talk (perhaps the best one). But we wanted something pythonic, developed with API first approach and fun to create and maintain.
